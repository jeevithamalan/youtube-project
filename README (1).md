## What I Have Done in This Project
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to forecast weekly sales for different store types. The application is built using Python and Streamlit, providing an interactive interface for users to input relevant features and obtain sales predictions.

## 1. Data Collection
Objective: Gathered historical sales data.
- Process:
Collected data including store type, department, temperature, CPI, unemployment rate, holiday status, and store size.
Ensured data is clean and properly formatted for analysis.
## 2. Data Preprocessing
Objective: Prepared the data for modeling.
- Process:
Handled missing values and outliers.
Encoded categorical variables (e.g., store type, holiday status).
Scaled numerical features (e.g., temperature, CPI, unemployment rate).
## 3. Feature Engineering
Objective: Created meaningful features for the model.
- Process:
Created new features if necessary (e.g., interaction terms).
Ensured features are relevant and contribute to model accuracy.
## 4. Model Development
Objective: Built a predictive model for sales forecasting.
- Process:
Split data into training and testing sets.
Trained multiple machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Evaluated models using performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
Selected the best-performing model for deployment.
## 5. Model Training
Objective: Trained the final model on the entire training set.
- Process:
Fine-tuned model hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Validated the model to ensure robustness and accuracy.
## 6. Model Deployment
Objective: Deployed the model for real-time predictions.
- Process:
Saved the trained model using joblib.
Developed a Streamlit application to provide an interactive user interface.
## 7. Streamlit Application Development
Objective: Created a user-friendly web app for sales predictions.
- Process:
Designed the layout and interface with input fields for store type, department, temperature, etc.
Integrated the model to provide real-time sales predictions based on user inputs.
## 8. Testing and Validation
Objective: Ensured the application works correctly and provides accurate predictions.
- Process:
Test the application with various inputs to validate functionality.
Perform user acceptance testing to gather feedback and make improvements.
## 9. Documentation
Objective: Provide comprehensive documentation for the project.
- Process:
Write detailed README file with project overview, setup instructions, and usage guide.
Document the data sources, preprocessing steps, model development, and deployment process.
## 10. Deployment and Sharing
Objective: Deploy the application and share the project.
- Process:
Host the Streamlit app using Streamlit Sharing or any cloud platform.
Share the GitHub repository with detailed documentation and source code.
